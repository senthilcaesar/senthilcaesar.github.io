    <!--<p> I am Senthil Palanivelu, Bioinformatician in <a href="https://www.brighamandwomens.org/medicine/sleep-and-circadian-disorders/overview" target="_blank">Department of Sleep Medicine, Brigham and Womenâ€™s Hospital (BWH)</a><br>and <a href="https://sleep.hms.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Harvard Medical School (HMS)</a>, part of <a href="https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/" target="_blank">Purcell lab</a> directed by <a href="https://zzz.bwh.harvard.edu/bio.html" target="_blank">Shaun Purcell, Ph.D</a>.</p>-->

    <p>HiðŸ‘‹ I'm Senthil Palanivelu, a graduate with a background in Computer Science from University of Massachusetts Boston.</p>
    
    <p>I am a data-driven AI/ML professional with expertise in machine learning, 
        data analytics, and software development, specializing in healthcare and 
        biomedical research. With over six years of experience, I have led data 
        harmonization projects, developed predictive models for clinical applications, 
        and built scalable web applications using Python, R, AWS, and Docker. 
        My technical proficiency includes statistical modeling, classification, 
        regression, clustering, deep learning (CNN), and AI-driven automation. 
        I have contributed to neuroimaging research, implemented EEG and ECG 
        analysis pipelines, and optimized high-throughput computing workflows. 
        Additionally, my skills in prompt engineering, RAG, fine-tuning AI models, 
        and chatbot development allow me to bridge the gap between AI and real-world 
        applications. Passionate about leveraging technology for impactful solutions, 
        I am committed to advancing AI in healthcare, improving predictive analytics, 
        and streamlining data-driven decision-making.</p>
